## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jamie, and I'm a first-year Software Engineering Degree Apprentice at Bloomberg in London. As part of my course, I'm a part-time student and Queen Mary University of London and the London City Institute of Technology.

I've got experience in web languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as frameworks such as Node and React.

Currently, I'm learning Java with my university course, and learning UNIX, Docker, Python and Typescript in preparation for my next project at Bloomberg.
